 I’m currently studying Computer Engineering, in a Bachelors Degree in Engineering at Stony Brook University. I’m interested in archives, Macintoshes, and niche code solutions for all. Those guides we find online that are small but essential, the last chance we have at a solution, and a place to ask about them.
