- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CypherVault
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Engineering, in a Bachelors Degree in Engineering at Stony Brook University
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in archives, Macintoshes, and niche code solutions for SBU. Those guides we find online that are small but essential, the last chance we have at a solution, and a place to ask about them. 

" Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure..."
-Teddy Roosevelt
26th President of the United States of America
